# GeneaLabs
** Note: all repositories are being migrated to `github.com/mikebronner`.**

I am doing this for a few reasons:
- GeneaLabs is no longer operational, meaning that I am no longer running my web consulting company.
- I want to represent myself honestly, and not as a faceless company. The public repositories are still being supported by me directly.
- Users should know who is behind the packages, and I want to be directly available to them.
- I will be working on `mikebronner.me` to document the public repositories, as well as start vloging and and posting regularly.

If you are experiencing any problems with the move, please reach out at https://github.com/mikebronner. GitHub should be redirecting from GeneaLabs over to mikebronner indefinitely, but I will be updating Packagist and the composer registrations to point to `mikebronner` in the near future.
